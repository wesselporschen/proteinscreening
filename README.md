# Protein screening workflow
This repository contains 
1) code to select transmembranal protein structures from the Protein Data Bank for use in FEP calculations based on guidelines by Hahn et al. 2022. [Link[(https://doi.org/10.33011/livecoms.4.1.1497).
2) discussion and analysis of protein structure quality for the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) structure `4YK5`.

Part of Research Project 1, "Validation of the QligFEP Relative Free Energy Perturbation Workflow on G Protein-Coupled Receptors".
Done as part of Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences (MSc) at Leiden University.
